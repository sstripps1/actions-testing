# Graph With Controls

This app demonstrates how to use Dash Design Kit [Controls](https://tam.plotly.host/docs/dash-design-kit/controls) and [Headers](https://tam.plotly.host/docs/dash-design-kit/menus) within an app with one Graph component.

> This app demonstrates how to use different Dash Design Kit layout components. It doesn't have any callbacks, so interacting with the controls won't update the graphs.

## Run the App

> Note: If you initialized your app using an app from the App Catalog, the app's requirements are already installed. Go to step 2 to get started.

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
